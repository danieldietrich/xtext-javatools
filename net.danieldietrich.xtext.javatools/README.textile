h2. Setup

1. Clone project via git. Url: @git@github.com:danieldietrich/net.danieldietrich.xtext.javatools.git@
2. Run Maven @mvn eclipse:eclipse@ to generate eclipse project files

h2. Project Contents

* src/net.danieldietrich.xtext.generator
    Contains a StandaloneGenerator with support for generator slots and directory cleanup
    and a special implementation of IFileSystemAccess with protected region support.
* src/net.danieldietrich.xtext.generator.jvmmodel
    There are cases, where it is necessary to distinguish between different kinds of
    model elements. When using Xbase as basis for a dsl for example, one would
    like to generate model types to different Java packages. In this case the
    JvmModelInferrer has to create InferredJvmTypes for model elements. The @ImportManager@
    shipped with the Xtext Java Tools, along with a name converter, is able to accomplish
    this task super easy.
* src/net.danieldietrich.xtext.generator.javasupport
    The javasupport package consists of a JavaGenerator which takes care of generating
    java files in a default manner (DRY principle) and a xtend extension for java names.
* src/net.danieldietrich.xtext.generator.javasupport.imports
    Functionality for shorten full qualified Java names and creating an appropriate
    Java import section, mostly based on the implementation by Jan Koehnlein.
    Additionally model types (in contrast to plain Java types) are treated in a special way.
* src/net.danieldietrich.xtext.generator.javasupport.types
    Enhances inferred jvm model.
